# CCBD-3D-Family-Trees
A family tree is a special type of data structure as each node can have more than one parent. We must be 
able to handle all types of relationships.

Suppose you want to share the user stories with only your close kth circle.

The given problem is to find the distance from the source to all vertices within a radius of distance k
keeping in mind the the nature of the tree.
